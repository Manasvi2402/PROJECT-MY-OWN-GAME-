How do you plan to make your game engaging? 
The captain will have to save the Earth by using a laser sword which will help him fight the meteorites and the aliens. But each time the traitor comes close to the alien he can make them stronger and bigger which will make the captain attack the same alien two times. And the traitor has a weak spot. The captain will have to identify the spot on his spacesuit and has to kill the deceiver. To make it more interesting and engaging, the captain can collect fuel so that he can increase his speed. As soon as the score hits a certain amount, a checkpoint sound or the next level will be coming. A bright spot will be appearing on the screen and if the captain comes close to it, the traitor will die on its own and the game will end instantly.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
